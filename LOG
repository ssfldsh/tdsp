Bug:
	[-]	GetFootOfPerpendicular Function is not correct! The returned node is not on line.
		* The ')' of sqrt function is wrong!
	[-]	Also, need to check the result node is on line, not on the extension of a line.
To be Finished:
	[-]	Write the new special node file
	[-]	Read the new speical node file
	[-]	Add a schema to switch from different speical node file
			* Different special node with different speical node number, we have too many fuel station currently
			* A Folder that stores all the speical node files

ADD:
	Dijskstra with Fibonacci Heap support. Really Fast now!
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD:
	Pitu's EV <shortest walk Algorithm in pitu.cpp
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD:
	Temporal supported
Bug:
	[-]Mapping from original road ID to new road ID isnot correct, which results in failure of reading original speed profile
To be Finished:
	[-]Configuration Doc on Temporal

Bug:
	[-]Some nodes are still unreachable
		* 2 to 312559
		* Happens on the special nodes
		* Can be tested by earliest arrival time computation

LOST ALL THE DATA ON 30/8/16!!!
REMEMBER TO GIT EVERYDAY!!!		E!V!E!R!Y!D!A!Y!!!
Recovery by loging to dewberry.mgmt.eait.uq.edu.au, open a console, map the live usb as a vitural usb and boot.
Use Photorec to recover the whole data to dragon_data, and grep to filter the files.

Bug:
	[-]Static CH cannot open the correct distance between two nodes
	[]Time Dependent CH has not finished. The backward marking needs a new design.
	[-]Static CH is too slow

Work to do
	Dewberry:
		[-] Run a whole graph T2Hop
	Dianella:
		[] Re-partition the graph using natural cut
		[] Try to find the termination condtion for each search
		[] All pair between boundary nodes
